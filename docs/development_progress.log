[2026-02-18 23:25:00] [FIX] [BACKEND] Fixed regression where Multi-Timeframe backtests produced identical results or failed silently. Added 'symbol' column to MarketDataService.resample_data aggregation to prevent strategy crashes when accessing symbol data on resampled frames. This ensures 1h/4h/1d analysis runs correctly and produces distinct results.
[2026-02-28T00:54:38+05:30] [SUCCESS] [DATABASE] Implemented PostgreSQL UNLOGGED table cache (DataFrameCache model) with Arrow IPC binary serialization, composite index on (symbol, start_date, end_date), TTL-based expiry, and LRU eviction.

[2026-02-28T00:54:38+05:30] [SUCCESS] [BACKEND] Created decoupled PortfolioManager (engine/portfolio.py) with risk-aware position sizing (fixed/pct_equity/ATR-based), max position limits, stop-loss enforcement, and full fill tracking. Replaces tightly-coupled closure in backtest_service._run_event_backtest.
[2026-02-28T00:54:38+05:30] [SUCCESS] [BACKEND] Created VolumeAwareExecutionHandler (engine/execution.py) with square-root market impact model, volume participation limits for partial fills, and realistic slippage bounded by bar highs/lows. Replaces MockExecutionHandler.

[2026-02-28T00:54:38+05:30] [SUCCESS] [BACKEND] Implemented async task offloading: POST /backtest/async returns task_id immediately, ProcessPoolExecutor runs backtest in separate process, GET /backtest/status/{task_id} for polling. Original /backtest endpoint preserved for backward compatibility.
[2026-02-28T00:54:38+05:30] [SUCCESS] [FRONTEND] Expanded StrategyConfigPanel with Risk Management section: position sizing method selector (Fixed/% Equity/ATR), capital allocation slider, ATR multiplier, max position size, and stop-loss threshold. All controls conditionally visible based on sizing method.
[2026-02-28T00:54:38+05:30] [SUCCESS] [FRONTEND] Added RiskParams, BacktestTaskResponse, BacktestStatusResponse interfaces. Updated API service with runBacktestAsync and pollBacktestStatus methods. Zero TypeScript errors. All 99 hermes-data tests pass.
[2026-02-28T01:55:00+05:30] [SUCCESS] [BACKEND] Enhanced MetricsService with institutional-grade trade-level metrics: Total Trades, Win Rate, Profit Factor, Max Capital at Risk. Integrated PortfolioManager fills data into metrics pipeline.
[2026-02-28T01:55:00+05:30] [SUCCESS] [FRONTEND] Enhanced chart tooltips with institutional trade details: quantity, price formatting (₹), LONG/EXIT labels, colored signal dots, and en-IN date formatting. Tooltips auto-position to avoid overflow.
[2026-02-28T01:55:00+05:30] [SUCCESS] [FRONTEND] Added 4 new risk metric cards (Total Trades, Win Rate, Profit Factor, Max Capital at Risk) with Lucide icons. Cards appear dynamically only when event-mode backtest provides fill data.
[2026-02-28T01:55:00+05:30] [SUCCESS] [FRONTEND] Added Zod validation schema for risk parameters with institutional constraints (risk ≤10%, stop-loss ≤25%, max position ≤100%). Inline error messages display below controls. All 48 backend tests pass, 0 TS errors.
[2026-02-28T01:38:32+05:30] [SUCCESS] [BACKEND] Implemented 4-tier Quantitative Testing Framework (test_quant_framework.py): 34 tests across Deterministic Math, Cross-Validation (Pandas golden standard), Look-Ahead Bias Detection, and Edge Case Invariants. All 82 backend tests pass. Strategy coverage: 100%. Total coverage: 90%.
[2026-02-28T01:43:47+05:30] [SUCCESS] [BACKEND] Removed pandas from test_quant_framework.py. Cross-validation now uses pure NumPy reference implementations (numpy_sma, numpy_ewm, numpy_wilder_rsi, numpy_rolling_std). All 34 quant tests pass in 0.34s. Zero non-core dependencies.
[2026-02-28T01:43:47+05:30] [PLANNED] [BACKEND] TA-Lib integration plan saved to docs/plans/talib_integration.md. Three-tier indicator architecture: (1) Native Polars for simple indicators, (2) TA-Lib via map_batches for ADX/ATR/candlesticks, (3) PostgreSQL UNLOGGED cache for horizontal scaling.
[2026-02-28T02:07:00+05:30] [SUCCESS] [FRONTEND] Resolved npm security vulnerabilities (ajv, minimatch, rollup) failing the Frontend Quality Gate via npm audit fix.
